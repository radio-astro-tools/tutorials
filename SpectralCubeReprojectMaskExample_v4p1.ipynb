    "Adapted from a previous tutorial on the same subject by Adam Ginsburg, Eric Koch, Tom Robitaille, and Erik Rosolowsky. This tutorial shows how to take two spectral cubes observed toward the same part of the sky, but at different frequencies, and put them onto the same grid. Then, we use one spectral cube to mask the other, which is helpful for situations where the velocity structure of one cube is more complicated than the other."

In particular, for any given spatial coordinate in our cube, we will take the value of the brightest pixel along the spectral axis (the **peak flux density**).
